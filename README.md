# 🌟 Workshop on Generating Images using Stable Diffusion and Hugging Face

Welcome to the Stable Diffusion Workshop repository! This project provides practical exercises on building, fine-tuning, and experimenting with Stable Diffusion models using Hugging Face’s state-of-the-art libraries. The workshop aims to help you understand the fundamentals of generative models, specifically focusing on text-to-image generation.

## 📁 The repository includes three Jupyter notebooks:

- [Notebook 1] Stable Diffusion Model Building and Fine-Tuning
- [Notebook 2] Stable Diffusion Workshop Practical 2
- [Notebook 3] Stable Diffusion Workshop Practical 3


## 🌐 Introduction

Stable Diffusion is a cutting-edge generative model for text-to-image generation, capable of producing highly realistic images from text prompts. This workshop guides users through essential concepts such as:

- 🛠 Model building and fine-tuning
- 🖼 High-quality image generation based on text prompts
- ⚙️ Experimentation with model parameters (generation steps, resolution, guidance scale)

By the end of the workshop, you'll be equipped with the skills to fine-tune generative models and understand how different model configurations affect the output.

## 📋 Requirements

To run the notebooks, make sure you have the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch (with CUDA for GPU acceleration)
- Hugging Face libraries:
  - diffusers
  - transformers
- Additional packages:
  - tqdm
